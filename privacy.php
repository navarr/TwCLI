		<p>We don't do much with your information, but here is what we DO do:</p>
		<p>Your twitter information is never (one exclusion, see below) permanently stored on our server.  Instead, the OAuth Identification and other profile information is all stored in a temporary session.</p>
		<p>In the case of Geo-Location, this information is NEVER stored server-side, and is, in fact, sent to the script each time a command is posted.</p>
		<p>The only time we store any of your twitter information is when you change your theme, so as to be able to use it the next time you log in.  In this case, the theme css of the theme you decided to use is stored in these two files:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>uid_YOUR-USERID.css</li>
			<li>your-screen-name.css</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is, of course, necessary so we can load your theme upon your next log in.</p>
		<p>We do not <strong>YET</strong> run Google Analytics or other tracking software.</p>
